"There are two typs of header files"-

 1. pre-existing header files
 2. user-derived header files

 1. /* pre-existing = these are the head files that are already available in C++ 
                      compiler we just need to import them standard standard header file are part
                      of C++ library and provide common use functionalities */

                      these files are defined by user and can be imported using #include
                      These files are used to store own functions and declarations */
